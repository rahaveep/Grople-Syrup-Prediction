# Grople-Syrup-Prediction
Do have a look at my Resume
We have been given the monthly production quantity for a certain agricultural product (letâ€™s call it
Grople syrup, note - no relation to actual Maple Syrup) in 10 different provinces of a country
between January 2015 to December 2020. This Grople syrup comes from a fruit. It takes a few
months for the fruits to grow on the trees which bear them. It also takes a few days to extract
the syrup from the fruits after they have been harvested.
We would like to predict the production quantity for Grople syrup from Jan 2021 to Dec 2021.
